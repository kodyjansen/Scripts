Note: This section reports on the DAT files found in C:\Windows\Sytem32\Drivers folder.
Note: Normally, you should see 4 different named files that have what looks like a HW ID or System ID in the file name before
Note: the file extension. If multiple files with different System IDs are seen this is an indication that the audio tuning maybe
Note: incorrect and the internal microphone may not work properly, or in some cases it may not record at all.
Note: We only care about the last four characters in the filename before the file extension for this check.
Note: Example:  SAMSfppch_103C854A.dat
Note:       and SAMSfppch_103C854D.dat should not both be present on the same computer where 854A and 854D are for different models.

Conexant Audio Driver File Details
------------------------------------

Note: There is a Conexant audio driver block that MS put that blocks migration to Windows 10 20H1 (2004). See the link below for details

 CHDRT64ISST.SYS needs to be version 9.0.278.110 or newer for Windows 10 2004.

 UCI64a231.DLL must be version 7.231.3.0 or newer for Windows 10 2004.

 Note: the version number part will change in the filename so the number after UCI64a usually matches the 3 digit number in the version.

Note: Bromium recommends disabling this per this KB.  https://support.bromium.com/s/article/Disabling-Windows-10-Fast-Startup
Note: With some Thunderbolt docks its also adviseable to disable Fast Startup in Windows and Fast Boot in F10 for preboot support.

Note:  This check is for a High CPU utilization specific to RS2.  
Note:  Ideally we want fBlockNonDomain disabled or set to a 0 on RS2.  This issue does not occur on newer operating systems.
Note:  Refer to this URL for more details. https://getadmx.com/?Category=Windows_10_2016&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.WindowsConnectionManager::WCM_BlockNonDomain 
Note: Group Policy Check 2:  The second check we want to look for is if MBB Roaming is blocked by group policy.
Note:  If fBlockRoaming = 1 clients are not allowed to roam with WWAN.  If disabled or 0 they can roam internationally.

GP Check 1:  Prohibit non-domain networks when connected to domain authenticated network  
Note:  This check is for a High CPU utilization specific to RS2.  
Note:  Ideally we want fBlockNonDomain disabled or set to a 0 on RS2.  
 Refer to this URL for more details. https://getadmx.com/?Category=Windows_10_2016&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.WindowsConnectionManager::WCM_BlockNonDomain 
GP Check 2:  The second check we want to look for is if MBB Roaming is blocked by group policy.
Note:  If fBlockRoaming = 1 clients are not allowed to roam with WWAN.  If disabled or 0 they can roam internationally.

Note:  For Intel WWAN, it is expected behavior to see ModemControl.dll, GNSSDriverSUPLInfo-DTD.xml, and FWUpdateDriver.dll to 
       say Could not parse FileVersion.   For these files we are really just checking for presence on the system, so this
       message is good as it indicates the files are present on the system.

Description        = Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service implements the WS-Management protocol for remote management. WS-Management is a standard web services protocol used for remote software and hardware management. The WinRM service listens on the network for WS-Management requests and processes them. The WinRM Service needs to be configured with a listener using winrm.cmd command line tool or through Group Policy in order for it to listen over the network. The WinRM service provides access to WMI data and enables event collection. Event collection and subscription to events require that the service is running. WinRM messages use HTTP and HTTPS as transports. The WinRM service does not depend on IIS but is preconfigured to share a port with IIS on the same machine.  The WinRM service reserves the /wsman URL prefix. To prevent conflicts with IIS, administrators should ensure that any websites hosted on IIS do not use the /wsman URL prefix.
